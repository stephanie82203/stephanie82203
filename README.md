### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephanie


**_About Me_**

I am a new grad student from Carleton University, where I majored in Statistics and minored in Economics. 
My academic journey began with a focus on mathematics and economics, but as I went further, I discovered my true passion lies in statistics. 
This field allows me to explore how data and numbers relate to real-world scenarios, enabling me to communicate these findings effectively. 

âœ¨Currently, Iâ€™m boosting my technical toolkit by **self-learning SQL**, **Advanced Python**, **R**, and **PowerBI**

âœ¨I have a solid foundation in **Python**, **Java** and **R**, focusing on **abstract data types and algorithms**, skills I developed through my coursework in computational mathematics at school


_**Current Project**_

I am developing a personal financial system using **PostgreSQL** for data management and **PowerBI** for visualization and analysis. 


_**Goals**_

As I build a portfolio that shows my background to transform complex data into compelling stories and actionable insights, I'm interested to collaborate on data-driven projects. 

Leveraging my experience as a server and bartender at a Japanese Izakaya, I am planning a future project to analyze sales performance.


I believe in using data not just to understand what makes the world worse, but to figure out how we can make it better.
