### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephanie


**_About Me_**

I'm a 4th-year Statistics major with a minor in Economics. 
My academic journey began with a focus on mathematics and economics, but as I went further, I discovered my true passion lies in statistics. 
This field allows me to explore how data and numbers relate to real-world scenarios, enabling me to communicate these findings effectively. 

âœ¨Currently, Iâ€™m boosting my technical toolkit by **self-learning SQL**, **Advanced Python**, **R**, and **PowerBI**

âœ¨I have a solid foundation in **Python**, **Java** and **R**, focusing on **abstract data types and algorithms**, skills I developed through my coursework in computational mathematics at school


_**Goals**_

As I build a portfolio that shows my background to transform complex data into compelling stories and actionable insights, I'm interested to collaborate on data-driven projects. 
I want to connect with people who are passionate about sharing their thoughts/interested to someone like me.
I believe in using data not just to understand what makes the world worse, but to figure out how we can make it better.


_If you wanna talk about stat, econ, data analysis, or some tips of live, just reach out to me !!!!_
